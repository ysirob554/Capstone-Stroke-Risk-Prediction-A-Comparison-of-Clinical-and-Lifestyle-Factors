# Capstone-Stroke-Risk-Prediction-A-Comparison-of-Clinical-and-Lifestyle-Factors
Problem Statement:
Stroke is a major public health concern that can lead to long-term disability or death if not identified or treated early. Taking preventative measures is equally as important in reducing the risk of a stroke occuring. The objective of this project is to develop a model that predicts the liklihood of a stroke occurring and determine whether clinical risk factors or lifestyle-related factors provide a stronger predictive power. A successful model could help healthcare providers identify high-risk individuals and prioritize preventative care or monitoring. 
Model Outcomes: 
This project is formulated as a supervised, binary classification problem, where the target variable indicates whether an individual has experienced a stroke (1= Yes, 0= No). The models generate a probability score representing stroke risk, which is then used to classify individuals as high or low risk based on an optimized decision threshold. 
Data Acquisition:
The analysis uses a publicly available stroke prediction dataset containing demographic, clinical, and lifestyle information, such as age, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, glucose levels, work type, and smoking status. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with stroke cases representing approximately 5% of observations. Exploratory data analysis and visualizations were conducted to assess variable distributions, class imbalance, and the dataset's suitability for predicting stroke risk. 
Data Preparation:
Data preprocessing steps were performed to ensure consistency and model readiness. Missing BMI values were imputed using the median, and skewed continuous variables (BMI and average glucose level) were log transformed. Categorical variables one-hot encoded. The dataset was split into training(80%) and testing (20%) sets using stratified sampling to preserve the stroke rate in both sets. Seperate feature sets were constructed for clincal variables and lifestyle variables to support direct model comparison. 
Model Selection:
Multiple supervised learning algorithms were evaluated, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers. These models were chosen for their interpretability and ability to handle nonlinear relationships and imbalanced data. Seperate models were trained using clinical features and lifestyle features to evaluate their relative predictive performance. The clinical RF model was further refined using Grid Search hyperparameter tuning with stratified five-fold cross-validation to optimize model complexity.
Model Evaluation:
Because the target variable is highly imbalanced, accuracy was not used as the primary evaluation metric. Instead, recall and Precision-Recall Area Under the Curve were utilized to better assess the model's ability to detect stroke cases. Class weighted was applied to reduce any misclassification of the minority class. Threshold tuning was also performed to improve recall while maintaining reasonable precision. The results indicate that the clinical feature model significantly outperformed the lifestyle model, because it achieved a higher PR-AUC and recall score. In conclusion, medical risk factors, demonstrated by the Clinical Model are more informative predictors of stroke than lifestyle factors alone.
